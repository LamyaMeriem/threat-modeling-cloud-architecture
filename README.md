## 1. Project Context

As part of an infrastructure improvement initiative, **CloudLogix** is migrating part of its infrastructure to a public cloud environment (Azure / AWS) in order to host its internal applications.

The target cloud architecture includes the following components:

- **HR Portal**: an internal web application used by employees.
- **Authentication Server**: centralized authentication and identity management using **Azure Active Directory (Azure AD)**.
- **Cloud SQL Database**: a managed SQL database hosted in the cloud.
- **Object Storage**: cloud storage services such as **Amazon S3** or **Azure Blob Storage**.
- **Remote Users**: employees accessing the applications remotely over the Internet via **HTTPS**.
